### Move Details

**Now Pay Attention**

When you have time, at your HQ or in a facility, to outfit *another* character, roll +Links with that character. On a 10+, they take +[gear] and +1 forward. On a 7-9, they take +[gear] or +1 forward. On a miss, when they try to use [gear] this session, there will be a critical malfunction, either because you messed something up, or they didn't pay attention to how to use it.

**Try To Return It Intact**

If the [gear] from Pay Attention is used to generate something that should be valuable and should not be destroyed, but the player narrates how it *is* destroyed as part of using it, then both you and the other character gain 1 CP at the end of the session. You can gain a maximum of 1 CP per session in this way.

**Technobabble**

When you baffle, confuse or just stall an NPC by spouting technical jargon at them, roll +Sharp. On a 10+, they are baffled or impressed and give you what you want. On a 7-9, they are confused but suspicious. 

**Hacked Firmware**

When another character uses [gear] and misses a roll related to that [gear], spend a hold to declare that you had hacked the firmware, allowing the miss to be rerolled. If the new roll is also a miss, then you will share in the complications generated.

**Void the Warranty**

When you try to overclock any sort of technology and push it past its normal limits, spend a [gear] and roll +Sharp. If you have Comms and a Neural Interface, you can do this remotely on cybernetics. On a hit, the technology can go beyond normal limits. On a 7-9, also pick one:
* It burns out and is useless until you can fix it ... hopefully
* It damages the user, and malfunctions until the end of the scene
* The GM will advance a relevant countdown clock



# Equipment

## Cyberware

Player chooses which cyberware goes in which health slots. Cyberware in 12 and 17 can be “healed” by a tech on the fly, 2 and 7 need resources and a surgery.

Assumption is that cyberware is realistic looking by default, though often with some “tell” or giveaway. Players can choose to style it in other ways when the cyberware is installed. Characters start with up to Chrome pieces of cyberware from the list below. You can have at most Chrome plus 1 pieces of stress-causing cyberware before suffering from Neural/Cybernetic System Overload Syndrome (NC-SOS).

For each piece of cyberware installed beyond the limit, the GM will give you an ongoing -1 to another Stat at the beginning of each session. 

Tough: Jitters, freezing up, coughing up blood, or worse carbon lubricant … you’ve pushed your body beyond what it can handle.
Cool: You’re losing your edge, trying to keep the mind, metal and meat all working together. The stress is degrading your ability to keep your emotions under control and think clearly.
Sharp: What were you saying? Who are you again? You have a tendency to zone out, miss the obvious, and just forget things you’ve always known as the stress of neural control of implanted hardware eats away at your mind. 
Style: No one trusts anyone, but they trust a stressed-out cyborg packing a bunch of implants a whole lot less than your regular ‘punk or corporate. It’s hard to be manipulative and charming when you’re clearly fighting for control of your body and humanity. 

### Stress-Causing Cyberware:

#### SynthSenses

Cybernetic eyes and/or ears. When your enhanced senses would help you, you can roll +Chrome for Assess.

Start with 2 Tags.

Available Tags: +thermographic, +amplification, +magnification, +telescopic, +microscopic, +dampening, +recording, +encrypted, +HUD, +lights, +sensorium 

Sensorium allows you to also capture other senses and sensations, such as smell, touch (including pain), and taste.

With Tactical AI, allows independent targeting of multiple hand-held weapons.

#### Comms

When you have comms installed, you can communicate electronically without moving or making an audible sound.

Start with one tag.
Available Tags: +encrypted, +jamming, +recording, +broadcast, +inaccessible partition, +iced

Comms without +encrypted can be intercepted. Any comms makes you susceptible to being quickhacked, +iced increases the time needed for a netrunner to break through. +recording lets you record communications to internal storage, while +broadcast lets you broadcast what you’re seeing.

With SynthSenses, you can project communications into your field of view. 


#### Implanted Weaponry

retractable claws, blade, pistol, monofilament whip or other small weapon. You cannot be disarmed. It is automatically +linked. 

#### Overclocked Reflexes

You react much faster than others. Roll with Advantage on any Act Under Pressure roll where reaction speed is critical. You automatically go first in combat. If none of your enemies have overclocked nerves, then you also roll with Advantage for Mix It Up.

#### Neural Interface

Allows direct neural control of an appropriately configured external device such as a vehicle, weapon, recording device, or hacked electronic system.

With Comms, allows the Driver to remotely pilot vehicles and drones, and the Netrunner to do wireless hacking / quick hack.

With either Tactical AI or +HUD on SynthSenses, allows you to roll with Advantage on Mix It Up for +linked weapons and deal an extra +d6 damage.

With Overclocked Reflexes you can also precisely define who gets hit with automatic weapons. 

#### Skill Shards

You may slot chips to grant certain skills.
When your slotted shard is appropriate to a move you are
making, take +1 ongoing if your relevant stat is +1 or less. If it is +2 or higher, you roll with Advantage.
You can slot two shards at once. When you acquire the cyberware, it comes with one shard.

If you also have Tactical AI, you can slot a third shard.

#### Tactical AI

An expert system enhances the user’s understanding of and operation within a tactical environment.
When you assess in a tactical situation, hold +1, even on a miss.
When Acting Under Pressure in a tactical situation, you can roll +Chrome instead of +Cool. The GM will take into account on a miss or 7-9 that you were giving up control to an onboard AI.

### Stress-Free Cyberware:

The following cyberware does not cause stress:

#### Dermal Plating

+2 armor, stacking with other armor.

#### Bone Hardening

+5 HP

#### Muscle Grafts

When fighting unarmed or with a melee weapon, you can roll +Chrome instead of +Tough for Mix It Up, and add +d6 damage

#### ChemSkin

A subdermal layer that changes the color of your skin. You can program it in advance with complex patterns, or instantly shift to simple tones. With Tactical AI, (and translucent or scanty clothing), you roll with Advantage for Act Under Pressure for stealth as the AI blends you in with the background. With Synthsenses you can also change how your eyes look at will. 

#### Compartment

A compartment built into a real or cybernetic part of your body which can contain a small item. It is well hidden but not interactive in any way. Describe where it is and how you get to it.

#### Health Monitor

Built in monitor for your physical condition. Optionally includes a dedicated tracer and alert warning to a virtual destination of your choice (typically to summon a Trauma Team to patch you up). With Comms you can send the details to anyone in real time.
 
#### Autoinjecter

Inject a dose of a drug if your Health Monitor detects a pre-determined trigger condition. You can manually cause the inject to trigger – describe how it is triggered. With a neural interface, you can trigger it by thought.

# Systems

## Combat

### Initiative

The character that instigates combat typically goes first, however if any character has Overclocked Reflexes, then they go first.  To break ties, use the Cool stat, then the Tough stat, then the Sharp stat if necessary.

### Damage

If you're attempting to cause damage to another character, you use Mix It Up. If the roll is successful, then the target will take damage. The damage is calculated from:

* The base damage from Mix It Up, plus advances
* The damage modifier from the weapon
* Additional modifiers from abilities, such as Sneak Attack
* Additional modifiers from situational factors

You can then reroll any dice that show numbers equal to or less than the number of +rerolls you have. If you have two stacking +reroll tags, then you can reroll dice that show 1 or 2.

The attack's piercing value is subtracted from the target's armor value, and the resulting armor value is subtracted from the damage. Neither Armor nor Damage can go below 0.

### Ranges

Weapons have ranges at which they are effective. Melee weapons are only close range.

The range levels for combat are as follows:
* 	Close:     Touchable, certainly hittable with a stick
* 	Near:       Not touchable, but easy move-and-hit distance
* 	Medium:  One ‘action’ of moving is required to get to near
* 	Far:         Two or more actions required to get to near
* 	Visible:    Far away, but at least visible


## The Matrix

Traces:
Trace clock for each run starts with three filled, minus one for each point of stealth, minus one if you're portaling through a remote backdoor, to a minimum of 0 filled. Once the trace is complete, the tracer knows where you're connected from.

Backdoors:
Instead of Declaring a Contact, the Hacker can Declare a Backdoor. If you have a backdoor into a system you roll Sleaze or Crash with Advantage for that system. Or you can connect without the ability to use hold without rolling. If you're running another system through a connected system with a backdoor, you get +1 stealth, but if a trace succeeds, you lose the backdoor as a contact.

Programs:
* Viruses give you +1 to Sleaze
* Breakers give you +1 to Crash
* Fuse gives you +1 to AUP when you want to Jack Out fast
* Scanner gives you +1 for online research, and +1 hold when you convert [intel]
* Sifter gives you +1 for Assess in the system, and +1 credits for paydata
* Pocket AI gives you +1 hold
* Ghost gives you +1 stealth

Can't run more than one copy of any program type. Can't swap programs mid-run, but can slot a new one to an empty slot.

Deck:
* Memory: 1,2,3 (number of programs)
* Storage: 1,2,3 (data you can hold)  
* Co-Processors: 0,1,2 (hold per run)
* Stealth:  0,1,2

A base deck is 2 Memory, 2 Storage, 0 Co-Processors and 0 Stealth.
1 storage = 1 credit worth of data (or 2 with Sifter)
