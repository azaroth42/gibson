Create a character sheet server, with voice command integration, and a web interface for managing characters.

Use the following technologies:
- Python
- FastAPI
- hypercorn for the server, with the uv loop
- PostgreSQL to persist character data
- HTML
- JavaScript
- WebSockets


The server should have the following features:
- Create, read, update, and delete character sheets
- Voice command integration for setting values on the character sheet
- Web interface for viewing and editing character sheets

The rules system is detailed in the file advances.md
The advances are parsed out already using generate_tree.py to write the ability-tree.json file.
