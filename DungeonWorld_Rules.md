# Dungeon World Rules Reference

## Basic Moves

### Hack and Slash
When you attack an enemy in melee, roll+Str. On a 10+ you deal your damage to the enemy and avoid their attack. At your option, you may choose to do +1d6 damage but expose yourself to the enemy’s attack. On a 7–9, you deal your damage to the enemy and the enemy makes an attack against you.

### Volley
When you take aim and shoot at an enemy at range, roll+Dex. On a 10+ you have a clear shot—deal your damage. On a 7–9, choose one (whichever you choose you deal your damage):
* You have to move to get the shot placing you in danger of the GM’s choice
* You have to take what you can get: -1d6 damage
* You have to take several shots, reducing your ammo by one.

### Defy Danger
When you act despite an imminent threat or suffer a calamity, say how you deal with it and roll. If you do it…
* …by powering through, +Str
* …by getting out of the way or acting fast, +Dex
* …by enduring, +Con
* …with quick thinking, +Int
* …through mental fortitude, +Wis
* …using charm and social grace, +Cha

On a 10+, you do what you set out to, the threat doesn’t come to bear. On a 7–9, you stumble, hesitate, or flinch: the GM will offer you a worse outcome, hard bargain, or ugly choice.

### Defend
When you stand in defense of a person, item, or location under attack, roll+Con. On a 10+, hold 3. On a 7–9, hold 1. So long as you stand in defense, when you or the thing you defend is attacked you may spend hold, 1 for 1, to choose an option:
* Redirect an attack from the thing you defend to yourself
* Halve the attack’s effect or damage
* Open up the attacker to an ally giving that ally +1 forward against the attacker
* Deal damage to the attacker equal to your level

### Spout Lore
When you consult your accumulated knowledge about something, roll+Int. On a 10+ the GM will tell you something interesting and useful about the subject relevant to your situation. On a 7–9 the GM will only tell you something interesting—it’s on you to make it useful. The GM might ask you “How do you know this?” Tell them the truth, now.

### Discern Realities
When you closely study a situation or person, roll+Wis. On a 10+ ask the GM 3 questions from the list below. On a 7–9 ask 1. Take +1 forward when acting on the answers.
* What happened here recently?
* What is about to happen?
* What should I be on the lookout for?
* What here is useful or valuable to me?
* Who’s really in control here?
* What here is not what it appears to be?

### Parley
When you you have leverage on a GM character and manipulate them, roll+Cha. Leverage is something they need or want. On a hit they ask you for something and do it if you make them a promise first. On a 7–9, they need some concrete assurance of your promise, right now.

### Aid or Interfere
When you help or hinder someone you have a bond with, roll+Bond with them. On a 10+ they take +1 or -2, your choice. On a 7–9 you also expose yourself to danger, retribution, or cost.

## Special Moves

### Last Breath
When you’re dying you catch a glimpse of what lies beyond the Black Gates of Death’s Kingdom (the GM will describe it). Then roll (just roll, +nothing—yeah, Death doesn’t care how tough or cool you are). On a 10+ you’ve cheated death—you’re in a bad spot but you’re still alive. On a 7–9 Death will offer you a bargain. Take it and stabilize or refuse and pass beyond the Black Gates into whatever fate awaits you. On a miss, your fate is sealed. You’re marked as Death’s own and you’ll cross the threshold soon. The GM will tell you when.

### Encumbrance
When you make a move while carrying weight up to or equal to Load, you’re fine. When you make a move while carrying weight equal to load+1 or load+2, you take -1. When you make a move while carrying weight greater than load+2, you have a choice: drop at least 1 weight and roll at -1, or automatically fail.

### Make Camp
When you settle in to rest consume a ration. If you’re somewhere dangerous decide the watch order as well. If you have enough XP you may Level Up. When you wake from at least a few uninterrupted hours of sleep heal damage equal to half your max HP.

### Take Watch
When you you’re on watch and something approaches the camp roll+Wis. On a 10+ you’re able to wake the camp and prepare a response, the camp takes +1 forward. On a 7–9 you react just a moment too late; the camp is awake but hasn’t had time to prepare. You have weapons and armor but little else. On a miss whatever lurks outside the campfire’s light has the drop on you.

### Undertake a Perilous Journey
When you travel through hostile territory, choose one member of the party to act as trailblazer, one to scout ahead, and one to be quartermaster (the same character cannot have two jobs). If you don’t have enough party members or choose not to assign a job, treat that job as if it had rolled a 6. Each character with a job to do rolls+Wis. On a 10+ the quartermaster reduces the number of rations required by one. On a 10+ the trailblazer reduces the amount of time it takes to reach your destination (the GM will say by how much). On a 10+ the scout will spot any trouble quick enough to let you get the drop on it. On a 7–9 each roles performs their job as expected: the normal number of rations are consumed, the journey takes about as long as expected, no one gets the drop on you but you don’t get the drop on them either.

### Level Up
When you have downtime (hours or days) and XP equal to (or greater than) your current level + 7, subtract your current level +7 from your XP, increase your level by 1, and choose a new advanced move from your class. If you are the wizard, you also get to add a new spell to your spellbook.
Choose one of your stats and increase it by 1 (this may change your modifier). Changing your Constitution increases your maximum and current HP. Ability scores can’t go higher than 18.

### End of Session
When you reach the end of a session, choose one your bonds that you feel is resolved (completely explored, no longer relevant, or otherwise). Ask the player of the character you have the bond with if they agree. If they do, mark XP and write a new bond with whomever you wish.
Once bonds have been updated look at your alignment. If you fulfilled that alignment at least once this session, mark XP. Then answer these three questions as a group:
* Did we learn something new and important about the world?
* Did we overcome a notable monster or enemy?
* Did we loot a memorable treasure?
For each “yes” answer everyone marks XP.

### Carouse
When you return triumphant and throw a big party, spend 100 coin and roll + extra 100s of coin spent. On a 10+ choose 3. On a 7–9 choose 1. On a miss, you still choose one, but things get really out of hand.
* You befriend a useful NPC
* You hear rumors of an opportunity
* You gain useful information
* You are not entangled, ensorcelled, or tricked

### Supply
When you go to buy something with gold on hand, if it’s something readily available in the settlement you’re in, you can buy it at market price. If it’s something special, beyond what’s usually available here, or non-mundane, roll+Cha. On a 10+ you find what you’re looking for at a fair price. On a 7–9 you’ll have to pay more or settle for something similar.

### Recover
When you do nothing but rest in comfort and safety after a day of rest you recover all your HP. After three days of rest you remove one debility of your choice. If you’re under the care of a healer (magical or otherwise) you heal a debility for every two days of rest instead.

### Recruit
When you put out word that you’re looking to hire help, roll. If you make it known…
* …that your pay is generous, take +1
* …what you’re setting out to do, take +1
* …that they’ll get a share of whatever you find, take +1
If you have a useful reputation around these parts take an additional +1. On a 10+ you’ve got your pick of a number of skilled applicants, your choice who you hire, no penalty for not taking them along. On a 7–9 you’ll have to settle for someone close or turn them away. On a miss someone influential and ill-suited declares they’d like to come along (a foolhardy youth, a loose-cannon, or a veiled enemy, for example), bring them and take the consequences or turn them away. If you turn away applicants you take -1 forward to Recruit.

### Outstanding Warrants
When you return to a civilized place in which you’ve caused trouble before, roll+Cha. On a hit, word has spread of your deeds and everyone recognizes you. On a 7–9, that, and, the GM chooses a complication:
* The local constabulary has a warrant out for your arrest
* Someone has put a price on your head
* Someone important to you has been put in a bad spot as a result of your actions

### Bolster
When you spend your leisure time in study, meditation, or hard practice, you gain preparation. If you prepare for a week or two, 1 preparation. If you prepare for a month or longer, 3 preparation. When your preparation pays off spend 1 preparation for +1 to any roll. You can only spend one preparation per roll.

# THE CLERIC

## Starting Moves

### Deity
You serve and worship some deity or power which grants you spells. Give your god a name (maybe Helferth, Sucellus, Zorica or Krugon the Bleak) and choose your deity’s domain:
* [ ] Healing and Restoration
* [ ] Bloody Conquest
* [ ] Civilization
* [ ] Knowledge and Hidden Things
* [ ] The Downtrodden and Forgotten
* [ ] What Lies Beneath

Choose one precept of your religion:

### Turn Undead
When you hold your holy symbol aloft and call on your deity for protection, roll+Wis. ✴On a 7+, so long as you continue to pray and brandish your holy symbol, no undead may come within reach of you. ✴On a 10+, you also momentarily daze intelligent undead and cause mindless undead to flee. Aggression breaks the effects and they are able to act as normal. Intelligent undead may still find ways to harry you from afar. They’re clever like that.

### Commune
When you spend uninterrupted time (an hour or so) in quiet communion with your deity, you:
* Lose any spells already granted to you.

When you unleash a spell granted to you by your deity, roll+Wis. ✴On a 10+, the spell is successfully cast and your deity does not revoke the spell, so you may cast it again. ✴On a 7–9, the spell is cast, but choose one:
* You draw unwelcome attention or put yourself in a spot. The GM will tell you how.
* Your casting distances you from your deity—take -1 ongoing to cast a spell until the next time you commune.
* After you cast it, the spell is revoked by your deity. You cannot cast the spell again until you commune and have it granted to you.

Note that maintaining spells with ongoing effects will sometimes cause a penalty to your roll to cast a spell.

* **Good:** Endanger yourself to heal another.
* **Lawful:** Endanger yourself following the precepts of your church or god.

* **[ ] First Aid:** Cure Light Wounds is a rote for you, and therefore doesn’t count against your limit of granted spells.
* **[ ] Divine Intervention:** When you commune you get 1 hold and lose any hold you already had. Spend that hold when you or an ally takes damage to call on your deity, they intervene with an appropriate manifestation (a sudden gust of wind, a lucky slip, a burst of light) and negate the damage.

* **[ ] Devoted Healer:** When you heal someone else of damage, add your level to the amount of damage healed.

When you gain a level from 6–10, choose from these moves or the level 2–5 moves.

* **[ ] Anointed:** Requires: Chosen One. Choose one spell in addition to the one you picked for chosen one. You are granted that spell as if it was one level lower.
* **[ ] Apotheosis:** The first time you spend time in prayer as appropriate to your god after taking this move, choose a feature associated with your deity (rending claws, wings of sapphire feathers, an all-seeing third eye, etc.). When you emerge from prayer, you permanently gain that physical feature.
* **[ ] Reaper:** When you take time after a conflict to dedicate your victory to your deity and deal with the dead, take +1 forward.
* **[ ] Providence:** Replaces: Serenity. You ignore the -1 penalty from two spells you maintain.
* **[ ] Greater First Aid:** Requires: First Aid. Cure Moderate Wounds is a rote for you, and therefore doesn’t count against your limit of granted spells.
* **[ ] Divine Invincibility:** Replaces: Divine Intervention. When you commune you gain 2 hold and lose any hold you already had. Spend that hold when you or an ally takes damage to call on your deity, who intervenes with an appropriate manifestation (a sudden gust of wind, a lucky slip, a burst of light) and negates the damage.
* **[ ] Martyr:** Replaces: Penitent. When you take damage and embrace the pain, you may take +1d4 damage (ignoring armor). If you do, take +1 forward to cast a spell and add your level to any damage done or healed by the spell.

    * The spell’s effects are doubled
    * The spell’s targets are doubled
* **[ ] Multiclass Dabbler:** Get one move from another class. Treat your level as one lower for choosing the move.

## Cleric Spells

### Rotes
Every time you commune, you gain access to all of your rotes without having to select them or count them toward your allotment of spells.
* **Light:** An item you touch glows with divine light, about as bright as a torch. It gives off no heat or sound and requires no fuel but is otherwise like a mundane torch. You have complete control of the color of the flame. The spell lasts as long as it is in your presence.
* **Sanctify:** Food or water you hold in your hands while you cast this spell is consecrated by your deity. In addition to now being holy or unholy, the affected substance is purified of any mundane spoilage.
* **Guidance:** The symbol of your deity appears before you and gestures towards the direction or course of action your deity would have you take then disappears. The message is through gesture only; your communication through this spell is severely limited.

### First Level Spells
* **Bless (Ongoing):** Your deity smiles upon a combatant of your choice. They take +1 ongoing so long as battle continues and they stand and fight. While this spell is ongoing you take -1 to cast a spell.
* **Cure Light Wounds:** At your touch wounds scab and bones cease to ache. Heal an ally you touch of 1d8 damage.

You cannot target entities with less than animal intelligence (magical constructs, undead, automatons, and the like).
* **Magic Weapon (Ongoing):** The weapon you hold while casting does +1d4 damage until you dismiss this spell. While this spell is ongoing you take -1 to cast a spell.
* **Sanctuary:** As you cast this spell, you walk the perimeter of an area, consecrating it to your deity. As long as you stay within that area you are alerted whenever someone acts with malice within the sanctuary (including entering with harmful intent). Anyone who receives healing within a sanctuary heals +1d4 HP.
* **Speak With Dead:** A corpse converses with you briefly. It will answer any three questions you pose to it to the best of the knowledge it had in life and the knowledge it gained in death.

### Third Level Spells
* **Animate Dead (Ongoing):** You invoke a hungry spirit to possess a recently-dead body and serve you. This creates a zombie that follows your orders to the best of its limited abilities. Treat the zombie as a character, but with access to only the basic moves. It has a +1 modifier for all stats and 1 HP. The zombie also gets your choice of 1d4 of these traits:
    * It’s talented. Give one stat a +2 modifier.
    * It’s durable. It has +2 HP for each level you have.
    * It has a functioning brain and can complete complex tasks.
    * It does not appear obviously dead, at least for a day or two.
    The zombie lasts until it is destroyed by taking damage in excess of its HP, or until you end the spell. While this spell is ongoing you take -1 to cast a spell.
* **Cure Moderate Wounds:** You staunch bleeding and set bones through magic. Heal an ally you touch of 2d8 damage.
* **Darkness (Ongoing):** Choose an area you can see: it’s filled with supernatural darkness and shadow. While this spell is ongoing you take -1 to cast a spell.
* **Resurrection:** Tell the GM you would like to resurrect a corpse whose soul has not yet fully departed this world. Resurrection is always possible, but the GM will give you one or more (possibly all) of these conditions to fulfill:
    * It’s going to take days/weeks/months
    * You must get help from ____
    * It will require a lot of money
    * You must sacrifice ____ to do it
    The GM may, depending on the circumstances, allow you to resurrect the corpse now, with the understanding that the conditions must be met before it’s permanent, or require you to meet the conditions before the corpse is resurrected.
* **Hold Person:** Choose a person you can see. Until you cast a spell or leave their presence they cannot act except to speak. This effect ends immediately if the target takes damage from any source.

### Fifth Level Spells
* **Revelation:** Your deity answers your prayers with a moment of perfect understanding. The GM will shed light on the current situation. When acting on the information, you take +1 forward.
* **Cure Critical Wounds:** Heal an ally you touch of 3d8 damage.
* **Divination:** Name a person, place, or thing you want to learn about. Your deity grants you visions of the target, as clear as if you were there.
* **Contagion (Ongoing):** Choose a creature you can see. Until you end this spell, the target suffers from a disease of your choice. While this spell is ongoing you take -1 to cast a spell.
* **Words of the Unspeaking:** With a touch you speak to the spirits within things. The non-living object you touch answers three questions you pose, as best it can.
* **True Seeing (Ongoing):** Your vision is opened to the true nature of everything you lay your eyes on. You pierce illusions and see things that have been hidden.

Missing an appendage may, for example, keep a winged creature from flying, or a bull from goring you on its horns. While this spell is ongoing you take -1 to cast a spell.

# THE DRUID

## Starting Moves

### Born of the Soil
You learned your magic in a place whose spirits are strong and ancient and they’ve marked you as one of their own. No matter where you go, they live within you and allow you to take their shape. Choose one of the following. It is the land to which you are attuned—when shapeshifting you may take the shape of any animal who might live in your Land.
* [ ] The Great Forests
* [ ] The Whispering Plains
* [ ] The Vast Desert
* [ ] The Stinking Mire
* [ ] The River Delta
* [ ] The Depths of the Earth
* [ ] The Sapphire Islands
* [ ] The Open Sea
* [ ] The Towering Mountains
* [ ] The Frozen North
* [ ] The Blasted Wasteland

Choose a tell—a physical attribute that marks you as born of the soil—that reflects the spirit of your land. It may be an animal feature like antlers or leopard’s spots or something more general: hair like leaves or eyes of glittering crystal. Your tell remains no matter what shape you take.

### By Nature Sustained
You don’t need to eat or drink. If a move tells you to mark off a ration just ignore it.

### Spirit Tongue
The grunts, barks, chirps, and calls of the creatures of the wild are as language to you. You can understand any animal native to your land or akin to one whose essence you have studied.

### Shapeshifter
When you call upon the spirits to change your shape, roll+Wis. ✴On a 10+ hold 3. ✴On a 7–9 hold 2. ✴On a miss hold 1 in addition to whatever the GM says.
You may take on the physical form of any species whose essence you have studied or who lives in your land: you and your possessions meld into a perfect copy of the species’ form. You have any innate abilities and weaknesses of the form: claws, wings, gills, breathing water instead of air. You still use your normal stats but some moves may be harder to trigger—a housecat will find it hard to do battle with an ogre. The GM will also tell you one or more moves associated with your new form. Spend 1 hold to make that move. Once you’re out of hold, you return to your natural form. At any time, you may spend all your hold and revert to your natural form.

### Studied Essence
When you spend time in contemplation of an animal spirit, you may add its species to those you can assume using shapeshifting.

## Alignment
* **Chaotic:** Destroy a symbol of civilization.
* **Good:** Help something or someone grow.
* **Neutral:** Eliminate an unnatural menace.

## Race
* **Elf:** The sap of the elder trees flows within you. In addition to any other attunements, the Great Forest is always considered your land.
* **Human:** As your people learned to bind animals to field and farm, so too are you bound to them. You may always take the shape of any domesticated animal, in addition to your normal options.
* **Halfling:** You sing the healing songs of spring and brook. When you make camp, you and your allies heal +1d6.

Fill in the name of one of your companions in at least one:

* **[ ] The Druid Sleep:** When you take this move, the next opportunity that you have safety and time to spend in an appropriate location, you may attune yourself to a new land. This effect occurs only once and the GM will tell you how long it will take and what cost you must pay. From then on, you are considered to be born of the soil in both lands.
* **[ ] World-Talker:** Requires: Thing-Talker. You see the patterns that make up the fabric of the world. You may now apply your spirit tongue, shapeshifter and studied essence moves to pure elements—fire, water, air and earth.
* **[ ] Stalker’s Sister:** Choose one move from the ranger class list.
* **[ ] Formshaper:** Requires: Formcrafter. You may increase your armor by 1 or deal an additional +1d4 damage while in an animal form. Choose which when you shapeshift.

    * The spell’s effects are doubled
    * The spell’s targets are doubled

## Wizard Spells

### Cantrips
You prepare all of your cantrips every time you prepare spells without having to select them or count them toward your allotment of spells.
* **Light:** An item you touch glows with arcane light, about as bright as a torch. It gives off no heat or sound and requires no fuel, but it is otherwise like a mundane torch. You have complete control of the color of the flame. The spell lasts as long as it is in your presence.
* **Unseen Servant:** You conjure a simple invisible construct that can do nothing but carry items. It has Load 3 and carries anything you hand to it. It cannot pick up items on its own and can only carry those you give to it. Items carried by an unseen servant appear to float in the air a few paces behind you. An unseen servant that takes damage or leaves your presence is immediately dispelled, dropping any items it carried.
* **Prestidigitation:** You perform minor tricks of true magic. If you touch an item as part of the casting you can make cosmetic changes to it: clean it, soil it, cool it, warm it, flavor it, or change its color. If you cast the spell without touching an item you can instead create minor illusions no bigger than yourself. Prestidigitation illusions are crude and clearly illusions—they won’t fool anyone, but they might entertain them.

### First Level Spells
* **Contact Spirits (Summoning):** Name the spirit you wish to contact (or leave it to the GM). You pull that creature through the planes, just close enough to speak to you. It is bound to answer any one question you ask to the best of its ability.
* **Detect Magic (Divination):** One of your senses is briefly attuned to magic. The GM will tell you what here is magical.
* **Telepathy (Divination Ongoing):** You form a telepathic bond with a single person you touch, enabling you to converse with that person through your thoughts. You can only have one telepathic bond at a time.
* **Charm Person (Enchantment Ongoing):** The person (not beast or monster) you touch while casting this spell counts you as a friend until they take damage or you prove otherwise.
* **Invisibility (Illusion Ongoing):** Touch an ally: nobody can see them. They’re invisible! The spell persists until the target attacks or you dismiss the effect. While the spell is ongoing you can’t cast a spell.
* **Magic Missile (Evocation):** Projectiles of pure magic spring from your fingers. Deal 2d4 damage to one target.
* **Alarm:** Walk a wide circle as you cast this spell. Until you prepare spells again your magic will alert you if a creature crosses that circle. Even if you are asleep, the spell will shake you from your slumber.

### Third Level Spells
* **Dispel Magic:** Choose a spell or magic effect in your presence: this spell rips it apart. Lesser spells are ended, powerful magic is just reduced or dampened so long as you are nearby.
* **Visions Through Time (Divination):** Cast this spell and gaze into a reflective surface to see into the depths of time. The GM will reveal the details of a grim portent to you—a bleak event that will come to pass without your intervention. They’ll tell you something useful about how you can interfere with the grim portent’s dark outcomes. Rare is the portent that claims “You’ll live happily ever after.” Sorry.
* **Fireball (Evocation):** You evoke a mighty ball of flame that envelops your target and everyone nearby, inflicting 2d6 damage which ignores armor.
* **Mimic (Ongoing):** You take the form of someone you touch while casting this spell. Your physical characteristics match theirs exactly but your behavior may not. This change persists until you take damage or choose to return to your own form. While this spell is ongoing you lose access to all your wizard moves.
* **Mirror Image (Illusion):** You create an illusory image of yourself. When you are attacked, roll a d6. On a 4, 5, or 6 the attack hits the illusion instead, the image then dissipates and the spell ends.
* **Sleep (Enchantment):** 1d4 enemies you can see of the GM’s choice fall asleep. Only creatures capable of sleeping are affected. They awake as normal: loud noises, jolts, pain.

### Fifth Level Spells
* **Cage (Evocation Ongoing):** The target is held in a cage of magical force. Nothing can get in or out of the cage. The cage remains until you cast another spell or dismiss it. While the spell is ongoing, the caged creature can hear your thoughts and you cannot leave sight of the cage.
* **Contact Other Plane (Divination):** You send a request to another plane. Specify who or what you’d like to contact by location, type of creature, name, or title. You open a two-way communication with that creature. Your communication can be cut off at any time by you or the creature you contacted.
* **Polymorph (Enchantment):** Your touch reshapes a creature entirely, they stay in the form you craft until you cast a spell. Describe the new shape you craft, including any stat changes, significant adaptations, or major weaknesses. The GM will then tell you one or more of these:
    * The form will be unstable and temporary
    * The creature’s mind will be altered as well
    * The form has an unintended benefit or weakness
* **Summon Monster (Summoning Ongoing):** A monster appears and aids you as best it can. Treat it as your character, but with access to only the basic moves. It has +1 modifier for all stats, 1 HP, and uses your damage dice. The monster also gets your choice of 1d6 of these traits:
    * It has +2 instead of +1 to one stat
    * It’s not reckless
    * It does 1d8 damage
    * Its bond to your plane is strong: +2 HP for each level you have
    * It has some useful adaptation
    The GM will tell you the type of monster you get based on the traits you select. The creature remains on this plane until it dies or you dismiss it. While the spell is ongoing you take -1 to cast a spell.

### Seventh Level Spells
* **Dominate (Enchantment Ongoing):** Your touch pushes your mind into someone else’s. You gain 1d4 hold. Spend one hold to make the target take one of these actions:
    * Speak a few words of your choice
    * Give you something they hold
    * Make a concerted attack on a target of your choice
    * Truthfully answer one question
    If you run out of hold the spell ends. If the target takes damage you lose 1 hold. While the spell is ongoing you cannot cast a spell.
* **True Seeing (Divination Ongoing):** You see all things as they truly are. This effect persists until you tell a lie or dismiss the spell. While this spell is ongoing you take -1 to cast a spell.
* **Shadow Walk (Illusion):** The shadows you target with this spell become a portal for you and your allies. Name a location, describing it with a number of words up to your level. Stepping through the portal deposits you and any allies present when you cast the spell at the location you described. The portal may only be used once by each ally.
* **Contingency (Evocation):** Choose a 5th level or lower spell you know. Describe a trigger condition using a number of words equal to your level. The chosen spell is held until you choose to unleash it or the trigger condition is met, whichever happens first. You don’t have to roll for the held spell, it just takes effect. You may only have a single contingent spell held at a time; if you cast Contingency while you have a held spell, the new held spell replaces the old one.
* **Cloudkill (Summoning Ongoing):** A cloud of fog drifts into this realm from beyond the Black Gates of Death, filling the immediate area. Whenever a creature in the area takes damage it takes an additional, separate 1d6 damage which ignores armor. This spell persists so long as you can see the affected area, or until you dismiss it.

### Ninth Level Spells
* **Antipathy (Enchantment Ongoing):** Choose a target and describe a type of creature or an alignment. Creatures of the specified type or alignment cannot come within sight of the target.

While the spell is ongoing you take -1 to cast a spell.
* **Alert (Divination):** Describe an event. The GM will tell you when that event occurs, no matter where you are or how far away the event is. If you choose, you can view the location of the event as though you were there in person. You can only have one Alert active at a time.
* **Soul Gem:** You trap the soul of a dying creature within a gem. The trapped creature is aware of its imprisonment but can still be manipulated through spells, parley, and other effects. All moves against the trapped creature are at +1. You can free the soul at any time but it can never be recaptured once freed.
* **Shelter (Evocation Ongoing):** You create a structure out of pure magical power. It can be as large as a castle or as small as a hut, but is impervious to all non-magical damage. The structure endures until you leave it or you end the spell.
* **Perfect Summons (Summoning):** You teleport a creature to your presence. Name a creature or give a short description of a type of creature. If you named a creature, that creature appears before you. If you described a type of creature, a creature of that type appears before you.
