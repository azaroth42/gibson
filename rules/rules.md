# Systems

## Combat

### Initiative

The character that instigates combat typically goes first, however if any character has Overclocked Reflexes, then they go first.  To break ties, use the Cool stat, then the Tough stat, then the Sharp stat if necessary.

### Damage

If you're attempting to cause damage to another character, you use Mix It Up. If the roll is successful, then the target will take damage. The damage is calculated from:

* The base damage from Mix It Up, plus advances
* The damage modifier from the weapon
* Additional modifiers from abilities, such as Sneak Attack
* Additional modifiers from situational factors

You can then reroll any dice that show numbers equal to or less than the number of +rerolls you have. If you have two stacking +reroll tags, then you can reroll dice that show 1 or 2.

The attack's piercing value is subtracted from the target's armor value, and the resulting armor value is subtracted from the damage. Neither Armor nor Damage can go below 0.

### Ranges

Weapons have ranges at which they are effective. Melee weapons are only close range.

The range levels for combat are as follows:
* 	Close:     Touchable, certainly hittable with a stick
* 	Near:       Not touchable, but easy move-and-hit distance
* 	Medium:  One ‘action’ of moving is required to get to near
* 	Far:         Two or more actions required to get to near
* 	Visible:    Far away, but at least visible


## The Matrix

Traces:
Trace clock for each run starts with three filled, minus one for each point of stealth, minus one if you're portaling through a remote backdoor, to a minimum of 0 filled. Once the trace is complete, the tracer knows where you're connected from.

Backdoors:
Instead of Declaring a Contact, the Hacker can Declare a Backdoor. If you have a backdoor into a system you roll Sleaze or Crash with Advantage for that system. Or you can connect without the ability to use hold without rolling. If you're running another system through a connected system with a backdoor, you get +1 stealth, but if a trace succeeds, you lose the backdoor as a contact.

Programs:
* Viruses give you +1 to Sleaze
* Breakers give you +1 to Crash
* Fuse gives you +1 to AUP when you want to Jack Out fast
* Scanner gives you +1 for online research, and +1 hold when you convert [intel]
* Sifter gives you +1 for Assess in the system, and +1 credits for paydata
* Pocket AI gives you +1 hold
* Ghost gives you +1 stealth

Can't run more than one copy of any program type. Can't swap programs mid-run, but can slot a new one to an empty slot.

Deck:
* Memory: 1,2,3 (number of programs)
* Storage: 1,2,3 (data you can hold)  
* Co-Processors: 0,1,2 (hold per run)
* Stealth:  0,1,2

A base deck is 2 Memory, 2 Storage, 0 Co-Processors and 0 Stealth.
1 storage = 1 credit worth of data (or 2 with Sifter)


## Cyberware

Player chooses which cyberware goes in which health slots. Cyberware in 12 and 17 can be “healed” by a tech on the fly, 2 and 7 need resources and a surgery.

Assumption is that cyberware is realistic looking by default, though often with some “tell” or giveaway. Players can choose to style it in other ways when the cyberware is installed. Characters start with up to Chrome pieces of cyberware from the list below. You can have at most Chrome plus 1 pieces of stress-causing cyberware before suffering from Neural/Cybernetic System Overload Syndrome (NC-SOS).

For each piece of cyberware installed beyond the limit, the GM will give you an ongoing -1 to another Stat at the beginning of each session. 

Tough: Jitters, freezing up, coughing up blood, or worse carbon lubricant … you’ve pushed your body beyond what it can handle.
Cool: You’re losing your edge, trying to keep the mind, metal and meat all working together. The stress is degrading your ability to keep your emotions under control and think clearly.
Sharp: What were you saying? Who are you again? You have a tendency to zone out, miss the obvious, and just forget things you’ve always known as the stress of neural control of implanted hardware eats away at your mind. 
Style: No one trusts anyone, but they trust a stressed-out cyborg packing a bunch of implants a whole lot less than your regular ‘punk or corporate. It’s hard to be manipulative and charming when you’re clearly fighting for control of your body and humanity.
