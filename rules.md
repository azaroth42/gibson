The game is a cyberpunk RPG, where players control characters in a cyberpunk world. The rules are based on Apocalypse World, but with some cyberpunk-specific rules. They are also based on The Sprawl, and Asterisk World (a points based system for PbtA). 

There are 5 stats, each of which ranges from -1 to +3.
- Tough
- Cool
- Sharp
- Style
- Chrome

The starting values are selected by the player from the pool of: -1, 0, +1, +1, +2 

Each character has a section for bonds, which are relationships with other characters.
Along with Chrome, there is a Stress tracker, which is the amount of cyberware that the character has installed. If Stress is higher than Chrome +1, the character has a -1 to a stat assigned by the GM for each point it is above Chrome +1. 

Each character has a name and a playbook.
The playbooks are:
- Killer
- Infiltrator
- Netrunner
- Driver
- Face
- Juicer
- Razor
- Courier
- Investigator
- Tech
- Streamer

The basic moves which all characters have are:
- Mix It Up (Tough)
- Fight Another Day (Tough)
- Act Under Pressure (Cool)
- First Aid (Cool)
- Research (Sharp)
- Assess (Sharp)
- Fast Talk (Style)
- Hit the Streets (Style)
- Assist (Bonds)

Some characters also have "Do Science!" (Sharp), which allows them to research and develop new technologies.

Advancement is done through Character Points (CP) which are spent to buy new abilities, including new moves and raising stats. The new abilities are arranged in a tree, with abilities having both a cost in CP and a prerequisite of the parent node in the tree. The top nodes of the tree are the basic moves.

The tree is defined in the file: ability-tree.json
